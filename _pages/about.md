Hi! I'm Ziqi Zhang (pronounced as /tzi'chi chang/). I'm currently a Postdoc Researcher at UIUC, supervised by [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/index.html). I received my Ph.D degree in the School of Computer Science from Peking University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Ding Li](https://marapapman.github.io/), Prof. [Yao Guo](https://yaoguopku.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiangqun Chen](https://dblp.org/pid/49/628.html). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree from the School of EECS, Peking University. 

My research interests lie in AI security, software engineering, and software security. My research topics include trusted AI, AI with trusted hardware (e.g., SGX, TDX, TrustZone), AI4SE, and SE4AI. I have published several papers at top-tier conferences in various domains, including computer security (S&P, USENIX Security, CCS), software engineering (ESEC/FSE, ICSE, ISSTA, ISSRE), AI (ICML, WWW), and ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp).
I'm always open to collaborations. Feel free to contact me if you want my collaboration or suggestions for your research projects! In addition to the aforementioned research interests, I am also open to other related research problems!

Misc
=====
After work, I enjoy playing basketball and working out at the gym. I was a member of the men's basketball teams for the EECS (for nine years) and CS (for two years) departments at Peking University. I served as the captain and coach of both teams. I was also a member of Peking University’s second-tier men's basketball team. Currently, I play for Gyzers, the oldest Chinese basketball team at UIUC.
